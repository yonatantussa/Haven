🌟 Inspiration

Haven was inspired by the growing number of natural disasters and the urgent need for fast, organized, and efficient support systems. With Hurricane Helene and countless other recent disasters affecting millions of lives, we recognized the need for a platform that empowers individuals and organizations to quickly provide relief. Watching communities struggle to connect evacuees with resources like shelter and essential supplies pushed us to create a tool that simplifies and accelerates this process. Our goal is to turn compassion into action by building a stronger network of support when it's needed most.

Request goods and supplies.
Find temporary shelters quickly and easily.
